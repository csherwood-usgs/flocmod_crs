Flocmod_crs is a FORTRAN version of FlocMod by Romaric Verney, IFREMER.

Verney et al. (2011) Behaviour of a floc population during a tidal cycle:
Laboratory experiments and numerical modeling.
Continental Shelf Research 31:564-583.

Modified for testing and reference by Chris Sherwood, USGS.
Flocmod_crs is derived from flocmod.F90, emailed to Sherwood's home e-mail
from Verney on 15 Oct 2013. This is included in the repo for reference, but
is not part of the working code.

To compile on my Win64 laptop from a command window:
gfortran -c comvars.f90
gfortran -c flocmod_crs.f90
gfortran -o flocmod_crs flocmod_crs.o comvars.o

On my Ubuntu desktop (more standard):
gfortran -c -ffixed-line-length-none comvars.f90
gfortran -c -ffixed-line-length-none flocmod_crs.f90
gfortran -o flocmod_crs flocmod_crs.o comvars.o

Note in comvars.f90, the code can be changed to double precision by
changing the arguments in seleced_real_kind.
